    In an unprecedented turn of events, the city witnessed the hottest day on record,
    with temperatures climbing well above seasonal norms. Public health departments
    have issued advisories recommending limited outdoor activity during peak hours.

    Meanwhile, local businesses are adapting to the heatwave by adjusting hours and
    providing cooling stations for customers. Meteorologists suggest the heat will
    persist through the weekend before a slight cooldown early next week.
